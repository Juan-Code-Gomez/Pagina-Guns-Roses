                                    Well, she's all geared up, walkin' down the street
                                    And I can feel the slime, drippin' down her sleeve
                                    Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do
                                    Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do

                                    Well, it's late at night, and I'm all alone
                                    And I can hear her boots as she's near her home
                                    Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do
                                    Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do
                                    Scratch, scratch, she's clawing at the door
                                    Whoa, no, I can't take it anymore
                                    Crack, crack I'm feeling so sore
                                    I never should asked for black leather
                                    Black leather
                                    Ooh, black leather

                                    And you can try to hide, but you won't get far
                                    You can let her in, and you'll start it again
                                    Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do
                                    Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do
